## About this Agreement

While the Blaze.horse **Django Starter Kit** (the **"Project"**) source code is publicly available, it is **not free**. To use the Project in production, you need to [purchase a license](https://hub.piep.works).

This End User License Agreement (the **"Agreement"**) is fundamental to the relationship between you and us. Therefore we recommend to read this Agreement carefully before you download, install or use the Project.

If you do not agree to this Agreement, please do not download, install or use the Project. Installation or use of the Project signifies that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by this Agreement as well as our [Privacy Policy](https://blaze.horse/policies/privacy), [Terms of Service](https://blaze.horse/policies/terms) and [Use Restrictions](https://blaze.horse/policies/abuse).

## Definitions

Before we get started with the conditions of the Agreement, let's define the terms that will be used throughout it:

- When we refer to **"You"**, we mean the licensee. Before purchasing the Project, that's the individual or company that has downloaded and/or installed the Project for a Development Installation or Private Installation. When used for a Public Site, the licensee is the individual or company that has purchased the the Project license. If you work on a client project and have purchased the the Project license for your client, you (and _not_ the client) are the licensee.
- When we refer to **"We"**/**"Us"**/**"Our"**, we mean the licensor, Piepworks LLC. You can find Our company and contact information on <https://piep.works>.
- A **"Website"** is a single the Project project that is defined by its domain name and root directory (e.g. `https://sub.example.com` or `https://example.com/example/`). Each (sub)domain and root directory is a separate Website, even if the projects are related in any way.
- A **"Development Installation"** is a Website that is installed purely for the purposes of development and client preview. It must only be accessible by a restricted number of users (like on a personal computer, on a server in a network with restricted access or when protecting a staging website with a password that only a restricted number of users know).
- A **"Private Installation"** is a Website that is installed purely for personal use. It must only be accessible by You and Your family.
- A **"Public Site"** is a Website that is _neither_ a Development Installation, a Private Installation nor an Extension Demo.
- An **"Update"** is defined as a the Project release which adds smaller new features, minor functionality enhancements or bug fixes. This class of release is identified by the change of the revision to the right of the first decimal point, e.g. 3.1 to 3.2, 3.X.1 to 3.X.2 or 3.X.X.1 to 3.X.X.2.
- An **"Upgrade"** is a major Project release which incorporates major new features or enhancements that increase the core functionality of the Project to a larger extent. This class of release is identified by the change of the revision to the left of the first decimal point, e.g. 3.X to 4.0.
- The **"Source Code"** is defined as the contents of all files that are provided with the Project and that make the Project work. This includes (but is not limited to) all Python, JavaScript, JSON, HTML and CSS files as well as all related image and other media files.

Every time you see one of these capitalized terms in the following text, it has the meaning that has been explained above.

## Usage for a Public Site

Installing the Project on or using it for a Public Site requires a [paid license](https://hub.piep.works).

As the Project is software and software is intangible, We don't sell it as such. Instead, this Agreement grants a license for each purchase to install and use a single instance of the Project on a **specific Website**. Additional Project licenses must be purchased in order to install and use the Project on **additional Websites**.

The license is **non-exclusive** (meaning that You are not the only one who We will issue a license) and **generally non-transferable** (meaning that the one who purchases the license is the licensee).

On request, We will **transfer** a license to anyone who is also allowed to buy the Project licenses by law and this Agreement. The new licensee will take over all rights and obligations of this Agreement from You at the moment We confirm the license transfer.

A license is valid for all Updates of the same major Project release. We reserve the right to charge an **upgrade fee for Upgrade releases**. Whether a release is an Update or Upgrade is at Our sole discretion.

## Order Process

Our order process is conducted by Our online reseller [Paddle.com](https://paddle.com). Paddle.com is the Merchant of Record for all Our orders.

## Free Licenses

The Project can be used **for free in the following cases**.

Please note that the restrictions and all other clauses of this Agreement also apply to free licenses. You may especially _not_ alter or circumvent the licensing features.

### Usage for a Development Installation

We believe that it should be possible to test and evaluate software before having to purchase a license. Also, We understand that a web project first needs to be built in a protected environment before it can be published.

Therefore, installing and using the Project on a personal computer (like a desktop PC, notebook or tablet) or server for a Development Installation is **free** for as long as You need.

The usage of the Project in production (with the intention to handle production data or content) is _never_ considered a Development Installation, even in internal apps or systems.

### Usage for a Private Installation

You may also install and use the Project for **free** in Private Installations as long as they are not accessible by anyone except You and Your family.

Our [definition](#definitions) of a Private Installation allows the following use cases:

- Private sites for personal use, for example:
  - Apps for You personally (like a personal diary)
  - Apps for You as a freelancer (like a bookkeeping, invoicing or project management app)
  - Apps for Your family (like a private photo gallery)
- Experimental local Project setups for Your personal use (for example to try out the Project features)

However, the following use cases are _not_ covered and need a **[paid license](#usage-for-a-public-site)**:

- Intranets for companies, authorities or organizations, no matter if on a local or public server
- (Internal) apps for teams or entire companies, authorities or organizations
- Websites that are accessible by the public, even for personal/non-commercial purposes
- Use of the Project as a local CMS for a static or headless site without a license for the frontend domain(s)

## Restrictions

### Legal Restrictions

You may only use the Project in a manner that complies with any and all **applicable laws** in the jurisdictions in which You use the Project. Please respect all applicable restrictions concerning **privacy and intellectual property rights**.

### Making Copies

You may make **copies of the Project** in any machine readable form solely for the **following purposes**, provided that You reproduce the Project in its original form and with all proprietary notices on the copy:

- when deploying a Website to a server,
- when developing a Website on a personal computer or server,
- when working on code contributions to the Project or
- as a backup.

You may _not_ reproduce the Project or its Source Code, in whole or in part, for **any other purpose**.

### Modification of the Source Code

You may **alter, modify or extend the Source Code** for Your own use or with the intention to contribute Your changes back to the Project. You may also **commission a third party** to perform those modifications for You.

However You may _not_:

- **alter or circumvent the licensing features**, including (but not limited to) the license validation and payment prompts or
- **resell, redistribute or transfer** the modified or derivative version.

Please note that We **can't provide technical support** for modified or derivative versions of the Source Code.

### Your Relationship to Third Parties

You are generally _not_ allowed to **sell, assign, license, disclose, distribute, or otherwise transfer or make available** the Project or its Source Code, in whole or in part, in any form to any third parties.

The following cases are exempted from this restriction:

- Project licenses may be transferred to a new licensee by requesting the transfer from Us ([see above](#usage-for-a-public-site)).
- You may create Websites for third parties (e.g. as an agency or freelancer for a client). Together with this Website, You may bill Your client for the used Project license. You may also include the license price in a flat rate. Please note that the licensee in both of these cases is still You unless You request to transfer the license to Your client. If Your price exceeds the price You paid to Us, You need to give Your client the option to purchase the license directly from Us.
- You may make the Project available to customers via a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offering, provided You ensure that each Website has a valid Project license purchased either by You or Your customer. If multiple customers share a Website, each customer needs at least one license. Your offering _must not_ appear to be provided or officially endorsed by Us.
- You may make a Project installation available to employees or partners of You or Your Website client. You may also disclose and distribute the Project’s Source Code to Your client together with the source code of the Website You created for them.
- You may disclose the Source Code to individuals or companies that are involved in the development or operation of Your Website (e.g. agencies, design or development freelancers, hosting providers or administrators).

E.g. the following cases are explicitly **_not_ allowed**:

- Selling, licensing or distributing a new product based on the Project that modifies or hides the Project’s identity
- Forking the Project and selling the modified version ([see above](#modification-of-the-source-code))

The same shall apply if a gap requiring supplementation arises after conclusion of this Agreement. The parties shall replace the invalid, void or unenforceable provision or gap requiring filling by a valid provision which in its legal or economic content takes account of the invalid, void provision and the overall content of the agreement.
