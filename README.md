# Django Starter

A little [Piepworks](https://piep.works) project.

## Requirements

- [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/)
- [Python version 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

## Installation

```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piepworks/django-starter/main/script/setup.sh)"
```

Here's what the `curl` flags mean if you're interested:

- `-f` = "Fail fast with no output at all on server errors."
- `-s` = "Silent or quiet mode."
- `-S` = "When used with -s, --silent, it makes curl show an error message if it fails."
- `-L` = "If the server reports that the requested page has moved to a different location (indicated
  with a Location: header and a 3XX response code), this option will make curl redo the request on
  the new place."
